# NGO Website Platform
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) strive to address some of the most pressing global issues and promote a better future for all. However, providing education to the uneducated is a significant challenge, and existing online platforms can be costly. To address this issue, we have developed a website that offers NGOs a tool to create their websites and a platform to promote their events and activities. Our solution assists NGOs in building their online presence and increasing their outreach to raise awareness and garner volunteers to support their cause.

# Key Features
### User registration:
NGOs can register on the website by providing their basic information such as the name of the organization, contact information and information about their work. They also need to create a username and password to log into their account.
### Creation of web pages: 
After registration, NGOs can create web pages where they can present their work, past events, future events and mission. The website builder is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing NGOs to add images, videos, and text to their websites.
### Landing page creation: 
A landing page is created for each registered NGO, displaying their logo, information about their work, upcoming events, and links to websites and social media.
### Event management: 
NGOs can create and manage their own events through the website. They can add event information such as date, time, location, description, and images. The website can also have a calendar view that shows all upcoming events for each NGO.
### Dashboard: 
The website has a clean and functional dashboard that allows NGOs to customize their homepage, web pages, and events. The dashboard also provides insights and analytics about the NGO's online presence and engagement.
### Volunteer Registration: 
Interested volunteers can register on the website by providing their basic information such as name, email address, and location. NGOs can see the list of registered volunteers and communicate with them for future cooperation.
### Donation Portal: 
The website may have a separate donation portal for each NGO that allows visitors to make donations directly to the organization.
### Notification system: 
The website has a notification system that allows NGOs to communicate with each other and collaborate for future events.
### Chat Room: 
The website has a chat room that allows NGOs to interact with volunteers and other NGOs in real-time.
