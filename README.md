To address the problem statement, we can develop a website that provides a platform for NGOs to create their websites and showcase their events and activities. The website should also have features that allow NGOs to connect with interested volunteers and collaborate with other NGOs.

The following features can be implemented to achieve the objectives:

User registration: NGOs can register on the website by providing their basic information, such as organization name, contact information, and brief about their work. They will also be required to create a username and password to log in to their account.

Webpage creation: After registration, NGOs can create their webpages, which can showcase their work, previous events, future events, and mission statement. The webpage creation tool can be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing NGOs to add images, videos, and text to their webpage.

Landing page creation: A landing page will be created for each registered NGO, which will display their logo, brief about their work, upcoming events, and links to their webpage and social media handles.

Event management: NGOs can create and manage their events through the website. They can add event details, such as date, time, venue, description, and images. The website can also have a calendar view that shows all the upcoming events for each NGO.

Dashboard: The website can have a clean and functional dashboard that enables NGOs to edit their landing page, webpages, and events. The dashboard can also provide insights and analytics on the NGO's online presence and engagement.

Volunteer registration: Interested volunteers can register on the website by providing their basic information, such as name, email, and location. NGOs can view the list of registered volunteers and communicate with them for future collaborations.

Donation portal: The website can have a donation portal for each NGO, allowing visitors to make donations directly to the organization.

Notification system: The website can have a notification system that enables NGOs to connect with each other and collaborate for future events.

Chat feature: The website can have a chat feature that enables NGOs to communicate with volunteers and other NGOs in real-time.

Overall, this website can be a valuable tool for NGOs to build their online presence and increase their outreach. It can also help them to connect with interested volunteers and collaborate with other NGOs to achieve their goals.
