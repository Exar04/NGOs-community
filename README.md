To solve the problem, we can develop a website that provides a platform for NGOs to create  websites and promote their events and activities. The website should also have features that allow NGOs to communicate with interested volunteers and collaborate with other NGOs. 
 The following functions can be implemented to achieve the objectives: 
 User registration: NGOs can register on the website by providing their basic information such as the name of the organization, contact information and information about their work. They  also need to create a username and password to log into their account. 
 Creation of web pages: After registration, NGOs can create web pages where they can present their work, past events, future events and mission. The website builder can be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing NGOs to add images, videos and text to their websites. 
 Landing page creation: A landing page is created for each registered NGO, displaying their logo, information about their work, upcoming events and links to websites and social media. 
 Event management: NGOs can create and manage their own events through the website. They can add event information such as date, time, location, description and images. The website can also have a calendar view that shows all  upcoming events for each NGO. 
 Dashboard: a website can have a clean and functional dashboard that allows NGOs to customize their homepage, web pages and events. The dashboard can also provide insights and analytics about the NGO's online presence and engagement. 
 Volunteer Registration: Interested volunteers can register on the website by providing their basic information such as name, email address and location. NGOs can see the list of registered volunteers and communicate with them for future cooperation. 
 Donation Portal: The website may have a separate donation portal for each NGO that allows visitors to make donations directly to the organization. 
 Notification system: The website may have a notification system that allows NGOs to communicate with each other and collaborate for future events. 
 Chat Room: The website may have a chat room that allows NGOs to interact with volunteers and other NGOs in real time. 
 Overall, this website can be a valuable tool for NGOs to increase their online presence and reach. It can also help them  connect with interested volunteers and collaborate with other NGOs to achieve their goals.
