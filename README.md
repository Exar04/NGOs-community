NGO Website Builder and Event Management Platform
Introduction
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a critical role in addressing some of the most pressing global issues and promoting a better future for all. However, one of the significant challenges faced by NGOs is providing education to the uneducated, and the cost of existing online platforms adds an additional hurdle. Therefore, our solution is to develop a website that provides a platform for NGOs to create websites and promote their events and activities.

Features
Our website aims to assist NGOs in building their online presence and increasing their outreach to raise awareness and garner volunteers to support their cause. The website includes the following features:

User Registration: NGOs can register on the website by providing their basic information such as the name of the organization, contact information, and information about their work. They also need to create a username and password to log into their account.

Web Page Creation: After registration, NGOs can create web pages where they can present their work, past events, future events, and mission. The website builder is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing NGOs to add images, videos, and text to their websites.

Landing Page Creation: A landing page is created for each registered NGO, displaying their logo, information about their work, upcoming events, and links to websites and social media.

Event Management: NGOs can create and manage their own events through the website. They can add event information such as date, time, location, description, and images. The website can also have a calendar view that shows all upcoming events for each NGO.

Dashboard: The website has a clean and functional dashboard that allows NGOs to customize their homepage, web pages, and events. The dashboard also provides insights and analytics about the NGO's online presence and engagement.

Volunteer Registration: Interested volunteers can register on the website by providing their basic information such as name, email address, and location. NGOs can see the list of registered volunteers and communicate with them for future cooperation.

Donation Portal: The website has a separate donation portal for each NGO that allows visitors to make donations directly to the organization.

Notification System: The website has a notification system that allows NGOs to communicate with each other and collaborate for future events.

Chat Room: The website has a chat room that allows NGOs to interact with volunteers and other NGOs in real-time.

Conclusion
Overall, our website is a valuable tool for NGOs to increase their online presence and reach. It can also help them connect with interested volunteers and collaborate with other NGOs to achieve their goals. With the features mentioned above, our website can address the challenges faced by NGOs and provide a cost-effective solution for their online presence and event management needs.
